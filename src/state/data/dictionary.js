                item3Question: "How Adme will make money",
                item3Answer: `Adme is an option for Brands to encourage people, with Ad campaigns, to create posts with related content, and even sponsor the spontaneous photos, that they are posting every day. With Adme, brands will continue having a presence on the same famous social networks but this time by sponsoring content created by the users.
                Adme is changing the current paradigm as follows:
                 - All social network users will be, for the first time, paid for just posting.
                 - Social networks users will be able to post on many social networks at once from one single mobile app.
                 - For the first time, the spontaneous photos posts will be sponsorable.
                 - Brands will be able to launch Ad Campaigns on many social networks at once from one single platform.
                 - Adme monetization: The Ad Campaigns money will be distributed as follows: 
                         - Social media users: 75%
                         - Adme: 25%

                item1Question: "What problem or use case does your company address, and how do your potential target customers get by today in the absence of your product/service?",
                item1Answer: `The problem:
                On one hand, Brands need to advertise genuine content created by people but:
                 a - Social networks only distribute the content created by brands
                 b - Hiring professional influencers to request them to create content is not automated
                 c - People are posting a lot of spontaneous photos with brands, products, and places that can be sponsorable but there is not a mechanism to do that.
                And, on the other hand, 
                 d - social networks users, are posting a lot of content with brands, products, and places, generating influence to their friends and followers, but no one is paying them for that
                Solution
                 - Adme lets brands sponsor content created by people (based on a brief or just spontaneous) in addition to letting people post on their social networks walls content created by brands as well.
                 - All social network users are considered influencers. And for the first time, their spontaneous photo will be paid.
                
                Without Adme:
                 a - Brands' content is delivered by the platforms only. It is not possible to ask people to post them on their walls.
                 b - Not automated. Brands contact influencers or their agent directly. Prices are not standardized.
                c - Not possible
                d - Social networks users continue posting branded photos making brands enjoy the benefits of their influence without rewarding content owners for that`,
                item2Question: "What makes your company stand out amongst that competition?",
                item2Answer: `If Web1 is about information, Web2 is about content creation and social media. With Web2, running from around 2005 to the present day, users became active creators and the web went from being a reading platform to a publishing platform. Bu Web2 had a dark side: the main platforms vaccinated up to the entire economy. In Web2, the user-created the value that the platform enjoyed.
                Adme complies with the web3 concept where content creators demand payment of the benefits generated by the influence they achieve on social networks with said content.`,
                item4Question: "How far along is Adme?",
                item4Answer: `We have version 1 of both applications.
                We launched in March 2022 the first Ad campaign that involved one brand and twenty social media users.
                The plan is to continue bringing social networks users at the same time we launch more and more Ad Campaigns from existing and new Brands.`,
                item5Question: "How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time?",
                item5Answer: `We started talking about the concept in June 2018, and in September of the same year, we decided to quit our jobs, live off our savings and family loans, to work full-time building an MVP, with the goal of traveling to San Francisco and probe the concept there. After 6 months of working many hours a day, and after finishing the MVP, we traveled to San Francisco where we stayed for 1 month (May / June 2019). A period in which we pitched 3 times in pitching events. We met a lot of people and after sharing our idea through the use of the app that we had on our cell phones, we came back happy from all the positive feedback we received.
                We came back with no savings and debts, so we had to get a job while we continued working on the development of the platform with the aim of transforming the MVP into version 1.
                In February 2020, we were able to hire our first and only paid Full Stack developer. I say 'paid' because we have Fernando Messala, our Marketing specialist who, after hiring him for a particular need at the end of 2018, stayed with the team forever, making his contributions without receiving financial compensation in return, hoping that in some time Adme raises funds and can hire him full time.
                Something similar happened with Guillermina, girlfriend of Gaston, Javier, and Alexander (friends for many years) whom we trained as QA during the pandemic with the aim of helping them get into the software market and get a job. The 3 achieved the objective, and since then they have been working for large companies such as IBM, Globant while continuing to test Adme without receiving any salary.
                In December 2021 we finished version 1, and in February 2022 we began the path of launching Adme on our own with the strategy of going from less to more at the same time that we resume the path of seeking investments.`,
                item6Question: "Are people using Adme apps?",
                item6Answer: "Yes",
                item7Question: "How many active users or customers do you have?",
                item7Answer: `We launched the first Ad Campaign in Feb/March of this yes after getting the first Brand aboard and installing the Adme mobile app on 21 social media users.
                As the first objective is to solve the problem of the chicken and the egg, the first campaigns are not designed for Adme to monetize, but to increase the volume of brands and influencers.
                The results of the Ad campaign can be seen in the private section that we delivered to the brans after finishing the campaign:

                item8Question: "Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder?",

            q1Question: "¿Me pagan si uso mis redes sociales habituales? 💵",
            q1Answer: "Sí, tenés que seguir usando tus redes sociales habituales. Adme te permite linkear tus cuentas de Facebook e Instagram (y otras en el futuro) para que puedas postear desde una unica app. Ademas de la oportunidad de recibir dinero por esponsorizarlas con campañas publicitarias.",
            q2Question: "¿Es importante la calidad de mis posteos? 💰",
            q2Answer: "Sí, es muy importante, porque para recibir el pago por una foto, la misma debe ser validada y aprobada, primero, por el Departamento de Calidad de Adme y finalmente por el Departamento de Calidad de la marca dueña de la campaña publicitaria.",
            q3Question: "¿Importa si mis fotos reciben reacciones? 👍 ❤️",
            q3Answer: "Claro que sí importa, ya que Adme no solo te paga por postar fotos en tus redes sociales, sino que también te paga por el éxito que las mísmas consigan entre tus amigos y seguidores. Lo cual es medido por la reacciones que éstas consigan.",
            q4Question: "¿Hay alguna otra forma de ganar dinero con Adme? 💸",
            q4Answer: "Sí claro, nosotros lo llamamos 'Ingresos pasivos'. Una de las maneras es aumentando tu red de referidos, ya que continuamente recibirás un porcentaje del dinero que ellos vayan ganando. Cualquier persona, sea referido directo o referido de tus referidos te harán ganar dinero. Sin importar que tan abajo en tu red se encuentren.",
            q5Question: "¿Por qué es tan importante referir a mis amigos? 🏂",
            q5Answer: "Porque cada persona que se suma a Adme estará debajo de un referente directo. Por lo tanto si tus amigos son referidos por alguien más, perdés la oportunidad de sumarlos a tu red y, por lo tanto, la oportunidad de ganar dinero por el éxito que tengan ellos mismos y su red debajo.",

                item3Question: "How Adme will make money",
                item3Answer: `Adme is an option for Brands to encourage people, with Ad campaigns, to create posts with related content, and even sponsor the spontaneous photos, that they are posting every day. With Adme, brands will continue having a presence on the same famous social networks but this time by sponsoring content created by the users.
                Adme is changing the current paradigm as follows:
                 - All social network users will be, for the first time, paid for just posting.
                 - Social networks users will be able to post on many social networks at once from one single mobile app.
                 - For the first time, the spontaneous photos posts will be sponsorable.
                 - Brands will be able to launch Ad Campaigns on many social networks at once from one single platform.
                 - Adme monetization: The Ad Campaigns money will be distributed as follows: 
                         - Social media users: 75%
                         - Adme: 25%
                         - Social network platforms: 0%
                `,
                item1Question: "What problem or use case does your company address, and how do your potential target customers get by today in the absence of your product/service?",
                item1Answer: `The problem:
                On one hand, Brands need to advertise genuine content created by people but:
                 a - Social networks only distribute the content created by brands
                 b - Hiring professional influencers to request them to create content is not automated
                 c - People are posting a lot of spontaneous photos with brands, products, and places that can be sponsorable but there is not a mechanism to do that.
                And, on the other hand, 
                 d - social networks users, are posting a lot of content with brands, products, and places, generating influence to their friends and followers, but no one is paying them for that
                Solution
                 - Adme lets brands sponsor content created by people (based on a brief or just spontaneous) in addition to letting people post on their social networks walls content created by brands as well.
                 - All social network users are considered influencers. And for the first time, their spontaneous photo will be paid.
                
                Without Adme:
                 a - Brands' content is delivered by the platforms only. It is not possible to ask people to post them on their walls.
                 b - Not automated. Brands contact influencers or their agent directly. Prices are not standardized.
                c - Not possible
                d - Social networks users continue posting branded photos making brands enjoy the benefits of their influence without rewarding content owners for that`,
                item2Question: "What makes your company stand out amongst that competition?",
                item2Answer: `If Web1 is about information, Web2 is about content creation and social media. With Web2, running from around 2005 to the present day, users became active creators and the web went from being a reading platform to a publishing platform. Bu Web2 had a dark side: the main platforms vaccinated up to the entire economy. In Web2, the user-created the value that the platform enjoyed.
                Adme complies with the web3 concept where content creators demand payment of the benefits generated by the influence they achieve on social networks with said content.`,
                item4Question: "How far along is Adme?",
                item4Answer: `We have version 1 of both applications.
                We launched in March 2022 the first Ad campaign that involved one brand and twenty social media users.
                The plan is to continue bringing social networks users at the same time we launch more and more Ad Campaigns from existing and new Brands.`,
                item5Question: "How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time?",
                item5Answer: `We started talking about the concept in June 2018, and in September of the same year, we decided to quit our jobs, live off our savings and family loans, to work full-time building an MVP, with the goal of traveling to San Francisco and probe the concept there. After 6 months of working many hours a day, and after finishing the MVP, we traveled to San Francisco where we stayed for 1 month (May / June 2019). A period in which we pitched 3 times in pitching events. We met a lot of people and after sharing our idea through the use of the app that we had on our cell phones, we came back happy from all the positive feedback we received.
                We came back with no savings and debts, so we had to get a job while we continued working on the development of the platform with the aim of transforming the MVP into version 1.
                In February 2020, we were able to hire our first and only paid Full Stack developer. I say 'paid' because we have Fernando Messala, our Marketing specialist who, after hiring him for a particular need at the end of 2018, stayed with the team forever, making his contributions without receiving financial compensation in return, hoping that in some time Adme raises funds and can hire him full time.
                Something similar happened with Guillermina, girlfriend of Gaston, Javier, and Alexander (friends for many years) whom we trained as QA during the pandemic with the aim of helping them get into the software market and get a job. The 3 achieved the objective, and since then they have been working for large companies such as IBM, Globant while continuing to test Adme without receiving any salary.
                In December 2021 we finished version 1, and in February 2022 we began the path of launching Adme on our own with the strategy of going from less to more at the same time that we resume the path of seeking investments.`,
                item6Question: "Are people using Adme apps?",
                item6Answer: "Yes",
                item7Question: "How many active users or customers do you have?",
                item7Answer: `We launched the first Ad Campaign in Feb/March of this yes after getting the first Brand aboard and installing the Adme mobile app on 21 social media users.
                As the first objective is to solve the problem of the chicken and the egg, the first campaigns are not designed for Adme to monetize, but to increase the volume of brands and influencers.
                The results of the Ad campaign can be seen in the private section that we delivered to the brans after finishing the campaign:
